# pathFinder
Source code for PathFinder


you will implement basic pathfinding in unity using Dijkstra's Algorithm.  Most of the code has been provided for you.  For basic credit, all you need to do is implement Dijkstra's algorithm inside of PathFinder.cs.  I have documented every bit of starter code in PathFinder.cs so be sure to read and understand that before you begin.  Note that all of your code should be placed inside of the DiscoverPath function.
